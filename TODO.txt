What to do next:

* Writing out all the uniqueness results for Loeb's theorem, and unifying them

* Writing out geminal (geminal Ys) result.

* Writing out locally geminal categories results.

* Writing out X -> []X extraction of introspective theories from geminal categories.

* Finish uniqueness aspects of Loeb's theorem

* Writing out all the examples of models in Models.tex:
- Well-founded models
- Models given by initial models of theories with internal initial models of themselves
- Sigma_1 models relative to sigma_1 extensions of PA/ZF/etc

9. Writing out relationship to GL modal logic (K4 is easy, and then 6 gives Löb's theorem; the fact that the logic we get doesn't go beyond GL modal logic I don't know off the top of my head a good clean way to see directly. It would be nice. We can derive it from the PA model and known relationship between the PA model and GL logic). The GLS modal logic can also be discussed, and the relationship between GL logic, GLS logic, GL categories, and introspective theories [there is also a logic GLT, with A |- []A as proper internalizable axiom |- [](A -> []A), but where unmodalized negation and implication are not around as operators; this should correspond to introspective theories]. It's worth noting that we have []~A even when we don't have 0, by virtue of the non-representable total limit presheaf.

100. Write out naive set theory thing. [And also naive untyped lambda calculus]. For naive set theory, it may be useful to consider notions like A isomorphic to []P(A x A) rather than A isomorphic to []P(A) or such things, just because ordered pairs are a pain in this world.

Speculative:

Write out expository "Related work" thing about how in some sense, what we are focusing is the orthogonal complement to all the work that demonstrates the details of how arithmetic universes contain internal initial models of finitely specified lex theories: That gives us Gödel codes in a specific context, but we are focused on what can be done in any abstract context where we have Gödel codes. The two of these facts combine to tell us how arithmetic universes have the Gödel phenomenonon, but they are complementary legs. The part we are working on, people understand non-abstractly, but we wish to show the abstraction, to emphasize the bare minimum of machinery involved (lex categories, not even regular categories, much less coproducts, lists, etc) and also to bring out the categorical aspects of Löb's theorem (fixed points for presheaves, these needn't be proposition-valued, we get initial algebras and terminal coalgebras and they coincide, etc). Our free models demonstrate that the initiality is not core to GL phenomena, just one instance where it arises. Our free models allow us to consider working with this axiomatization taken as given, abstractly.

Speculatively, we should be able to make an introspective theory or GL-category like the Sigma-1 or full PA models that has instead some uncomputable flavor, like doing the same thing over some oracle, and this should give the kind of model that people do not ordinarily consider, showing some value to the abstraction. [Not that people aren't aware of how Tarski's indefinability theorem applies over all these things too, but, yeah]

Perhaps we can turn any semilattice model of GL modal logic into a corresponding GL-category (one where this semilattice appears as the subobjects of 1 or as the preorder reflection of the whole category), and similarly for GLT and introspective theories? That'd be great. Instead of just focusing on the subobjects of 1, we should also automatically get some corresponding fact for the full space by then using reg/lex completion or ex/lex completion. It will be much easier to at least show that any semilattice model of GL embeds into some introspective theory's subobjects, which suffices to show that GL is the appropriate modal logic for introspective theories.

The right result of the above sort should be that given any GLS lattice T' and GL lattice C', with a meet and [] preserving homomorphism from the former to the latter, we can create a corresponding <T, C, ...> introspective theory.

Actually, it may be easy to do something of the above sort for well-founded orders directly, and then appeal to the known relationship between GL and well-founded orders. To think about well-founded orders, it's something like working within the corresponding presheaf topos, but not quite. Let's think about the linear orders case first, then build on top of that.

In T-indexed world, it's like there are large sets (actual sets, arbitrary presheaves), and small sets (objects of T, representable presheaves). All arguments are just like that. An enriched category is like a large but locally small category, an internal category is like a small category. Many of our arguments do not depend on the smallness of C, just its local smallness.

Talk about free monad extending [].

Talk about naive set theory.

Talk about how models needn't be computable, or arithmetically definable, or countable, or any such thing. We can add an arbitrary function from N to N or such things to a standard theory and still get another introspective theory.

Sigma-1 construction can be seen as simple thing followed by Ex/Lex construction.

Needn't have an NNO in models, I think. At any rate, the arithmetic content is clearly low, since arithmetic is not visible in the theory of GL-categories in any direct way.

Write out non-lex 2-theory of introspective theories.
