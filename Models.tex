\section{Models}

\subsection{Automatic consistency results without models as such}
We already know that the theory of geminal categories is an introspective theory. And because every introspective theory is itself a geminal category, we know that the theory of introspective theories only prove $\Box A$ if it furthermore proves $A$.

Finally, we know that every lexcategory can be equipped as a geminal category in a trivial way, by taking its internal geminal category to be trivially $1$, even when the outer lexcategory needn't be trivial. From this, we can conclude that the theory of introspective theories is nontrivial in the sense that it does not prove its internal geminal category to be trivial. Thus, it does not prove $\Box A$ for all $A$. Furthermore, combining this with the previous paragraph, we have the stronger consistency result that for every $n$, the theory of introspective theories does not prove $\Box^n A$ for all $A$.

In this way, simply by consideration of the freeness properties already established in the chapter on geminal categories, we already know the theory of introspective theories to have highly nontrivial content, even without needing to find any models of it \quote{in the wild}.

\TODOinline{Discuss more why the stronger consistency result is really the relevant thing to think about.}

\subsection{Models based on sigma-1 or arbitrary extensions of PA, or ZFC, or etc}
\TODOinline{I will write this section in a sloppy way for now and then improve it later.}

\begin{construction}\label{Sigma1Model}

Consider a sigma-1 theory $\tau$ extending PA (or ZFC, or any such thing). Actually, for now, let's just consider PA simpliciter.

Consider the category $T$ whose objects are the sigma-1 formulas $\phi(n, m)$ in the language of PA which define binary relations on the natural numbers which PA proves to be partial equivalence relations (i.e., symmetric and transitive). Given any two such formulas $\phi(n, m)$ and $\psi(n, m)$, a morphism in $T$ from $\phi$ to $\psi$ is a sigma-1 formula $F(n, m)$ on the natural numbers which PA proves to correspond to the graph of a function between the subquotients of $\mathbb{N}$ corresponding to $\phi$ and to $\psi$, respectively. That is, such that PA proves the universal closures of the following:

$F(n, m) \implies \phi(n, n) \wedge \psi(m, m)$

$\phi(n_1, n_2) \wedge \psi(m_1, m_2) \wedge F(n_1, m_1) \implies F(n_2, m_2)$

$\phi(n, n) \implies \exists m [F(n, m)]$

$F(n, m_1) \wedge F(n, m_2) \implies \psi(m_1, m_2)$.

Two such formulas $F(n, m)$ and $F'(n, m)$ are considered to be equal as morphisms from $\phi$ to $\psi$ if PA proves them to be equivalent (that is, if PA proves $F(n, m) \implies F'(n, m)$ and $F'(n, m) \implies F(n, m)$).

Given morphisms $F : \phi \to \psi$ and $G: \psi \to \chi$ of this sort, we define their composition in the usual way of composing functions represented as graphs, as $(F \circ G)(n, m) = \exists p [G(n, p) \wedge F(p, m)]$.

This all describes the category $T$, which one can verify is indeed a category and moreso, a category with finite limits.

\TODOinline{Perhaps instead of imposing PERs from the beginning, we start only with the category of RE sets, and then take its ex/lex completion or some such thing. Like so:}

Consider the category $T'$ whose objects are the sigma-1 formulas $\phi(n)$ in the language of PA, and such that a morphism from $\phi(n)$ to $\psi(m)$ is a sigma-1 formula $F(n, m)$ such that $PA$ proves $\forall n, m . F(n, m) \implies (\phi(n) \wedge \psi(m))$ and $\forall n . \phi(n) \implies \exists! m . F(n, m)$. Two such morphisms $F(n, m)$ and $G(n, m)$ are considered equal just in case PA proves $\forall n, m . F(n, m) \biimplies G(n, m)$. Morphisms compose in the obvious way; that is, the composition of $F(n, p)$ with $G(p, m)$ is given by $(G \circ F)(n, m) = \exists p (F(n, p) \wedge G(p, m))$.

This category $T'$ is regular but not exact (that is, not every equivalence relation in $T'$ admits a corresponding quotient). Let $T$ be its ex/reg completion.

\TODOinline{Now, we describe the C inside T which is its internal copy, just by carrying out this exact same construction internal to T, and then we describe the indexed lexfunctor from T to C, which is a little more interesting or takes a little more care. Having this functor be indexed is where the sigma-1 restriction is important.}
\end{construction}

\TODOinline{Observe that we have somewhat distinct concepts of "T = PA Sigma-1, C = ZFC Sigma-1" vs "T = ZFC Sigma-1, C = ZFC Sigma-1", say. Also observe that as concerns ZFC, we can also consider for $C$ not just categories of definable subsets of naturals, but also of definable sets in general, or of definable classes.}

\subsection{Finitely axiomatizable lex theories}
A concept that will often be useful to us in the following.

\begin{definition}
A \defined{finitely axiomatizable lex theory} is a lex theory which, qua lexcategory, can be generated in finitely many steps of the following form, starting from the initial lexcategory: free augmentation with an object, free augmentation with a morphism between existing objects, or freely making two existing parallel morphisms equal. In other words, it can be presented by a finite lex \quote{sketch}. \TODOinline{Word this all better}
\end{definition}

\begin{TODOblock}
Discuss the concept of a lexcategory having initial internal models of ALL finitely axiomatizable lex theories.

As a bit of trivia, observe how this follows simply from having an internal free locally cartesian closed category on one object (verify the details on this; or perhaps from having internal free lex categories and the ability to freely augment internal lex categories with a new cell). Regardless of whether those details work out, conjecture that there are finitely many finitely axiomatizable lex theories such that having internal initial models of those implies having internal initial models of all finitely axiomatizable lex theories, so that the latter is itself a finitely axiomatizable condition.

Relate this also to the concept of arithmetic universes. Conjecturally, being an arithmetic universe is equivalent to something like having free internal models for sketches indexed by finite unions of internal objects (but there seems to be some hesitance in the literature to claim this? Understand that better). At any rate, an arithmetic universe should have internal initial models of all finitely axiomatizable lex theories.

This section basically only exists in order to claim that finitely axiomatizable lex theories which extend the theory of arithmetic universes are automatically examples of the next section.
\end{TODOblock}

\subsection{Theories with free internal models of themselves}
Fix some lex theory extending the theory of strict lexcategories, whose models we shall call \quote{gadgets}. Now suppose every gadget $G$ contains an initial internal gadget $G'$ (in the sense that $G'$ is a gadget internal to the underlying lexcategory $|G|$ of $G$, and for any other gadget $H$ internal to $|G|$, there is a unique $|G|$-internal gadget homomorphism from $G'$ to $H$).

In particular, then, this all applies to the actual initial gadget $G$. Internal to this initial gadget $G$'s underlying lexcategory $|G|$, we get a $G'$ as above. Because $G$ is initial, we automatically get a unique gadget-homomorphism $\introN_{G}$ from $G$ to $\Hom_{|G|}(1, G')$ as well. And because $G'$ is an initial $|G|$-internal gadget, we automatically get a unique $|G|$-internal homomorphism $\introN_{G'}$ from $G'$ to $\Hom_{|G'|}(1, G'')$ where $G'' = \introN_{G}[G']$.

This setup is thus a geminal gadget (with axioms 3 and 3' of a geminal gadget automatically satisfied by the uniqueness observations in the previous paragraph).

This immediately gives us models of our theory of geminal gadgets. For example, consider the theory of strict elementary toposes with natural numbers objects (let us call this an \defined{NNO-topos}, to make it less of a mouthful). This is indeed a lex theory in a straightforward way; indeed, a finitely axiomatizable lex theory. Furthermore, every NNO-topos has an internal initial model of every finitely axiomatizable lex theory. Thus, in particular, every NNO-topos has an internal initial NNO-topos, and thus, by the above, the initial NNO-topos is equipped as a geminal NNO-topos.

\TODOinline{It is important to observe that the initial NNO-topos is NOT an introspective theory. It is merely a geminal category.}

In the same way, the initial arithmetic universe is equipped as a geminal arithmetic universe. This is the structure discussed by Joyal and others after Joyal (e.g., Dijk and Oldenziel). \TODOinline{Give proper citations here}

\TODOinline{The initial arithmetic universe actually IS an introspective theory, via reasoning about Freyd covers that does not generalize to other examples of this section's phenomena. Discuss this further.}

\begin{TODOblock}
Extend the above discussion of initiality to discuss corresponding introspective theories, beyond just the discussion of geminality. Although, e.g., the initial NNO-topos is not itself an introspective theory, there is nonetheless a corresponding introspective theory of note capturing the initiality properties. Furthermore, even any lex theory that does not automatically come with internal initial models of itself can be freely bumped up to do so, in a suitable sense, and we get a corresponding introspective theory as well.

Specifically, let us say a theory is sigma1esque if the identity lex endofunctor on it is initial with respect to all lex endofunctors on it. Any lex theory $T$ has a free sigma1esque extension, in the sense of a sigma1esque lex theory $T'$ under $T$ with a unique map into any other sigma1esque lex theory under $T$. This $T'$ also comes with a unique map into the global points of any internal initial model of $T$ in any lex category.

If $T$ has an internal initial model of $T$, then the theory $T'$ also contains an internal initial model of $T$, and thus this theory $T'$ comes with a lexfunctor $\introS$ into that internal initial model of $T$. Furthermore, because $T'$ is sigma1esque, it then comes with a natural transformation $\introN$ from its identity functor to the global sections of that $\introS$. This equips said $T'$ as an introspective theory. And, as noted, this $T'$ is modelled by any initial model of $T$ internal to any category.

Thus, for example, if $T$ is the theory of elementary toposes with NNO, we obtain some introspective theory $T'$ extending $T$ which has the initial elementary topos with NNO as a model.
\end{TODOblock}

\subsection{Models based on well-founded trees/well-founded posets}
There are two flavors of models here: Those which give introspective theories (these come from well-founded trees using a certain size restriction; e.g., considering a model based on the von Neumann universe/cumulative hierarchy), and those which give only locally introspective theories with \Loeb's theorem fixed points (these come from arbitrary well-founded trees; these are related to the models used in guarded recursion theory, but our distinction between the roles of $T$ and $C$ has previously gone unnoticed and allows us to interpret these models as not proving $\lnot \lnot \Box 0$). \TODO
