Let $T$ be a theory with an internal model of itself

Let $T$ be any lexcategory. There is an algebraish theory of lexcategories with an initial internal model of $T$, but this theory may not specifically be lex. It is lex if $T$ is finitely axiomatizable over a finite language. In general, it may use limits of size as large as needed to express the theory $T$ (whatever size is needed for a sketch generating $T$, where a sketch is taken to be a directed graph and some equations over that graph in the language of lexcategories). Regardless, within this algebraish theory describing an initial model of $T$, there is such an initial model of $T$, which may have more structure around than simply demanded by $T$, and we are interested in extracting that structure. We do so now. \TODOinline{Word this all better}

Let $T$ be any lexcategory. There is of course the identity lexfunctor from $T$ to itself, but there may be others as well.

Let $T$ be any lextheory with an internal initial model of itself; that is, with an internal category $C$, a functor $S$ from $T$ to the global aspect of $C$, and a unique natural transformation from $S$ to $Z$ for any
