\begin{abstract}
The aim of these notes is to identify and draw attention to a certain simple and categorically natural kind of mathematical structure which both serves as an abstract environment for the reasoning used in establishing \Loeb's theorem in its traditional instances, and furthermore allows this and the associated theorems and fixed-point results of the \Goedel-\Loeb\ modal logic to be vastly generalized so as to be applicable at the level of types rather than merely that of propositions.

The core idea is the identification of those essentially algebraic theories satisfying the property that every model of these theories contains also, as part of its structure, a homomorphism into an internal model of the same theory.

This structure turns out to be viewable as a categorification of the Hilbert-Bernays derivability conditions of provability logic. In particular, it induces a bifunctor on each model of such a theory which is formally similar to the $\Box(A \implies B)$ operator of the \Goedel-\Loeb\ modal logic. Furthermore, various fixed-point theorems within these categories will be demonstrated. Out of these, the traditional instances of \Loeb's theorem in the context of provability of propositions fall out as a special case, as do the traditional propositional fixed-point theorems of the \Goedel-\Loeb\ modal logic. However, the generalization of these fixed-point theorems to the context of isomorphisms between nontrivial sets (i.e., sets with distinct elements, as represented by non-subterminal objects) appears genuinely new and opens up exciting avenues for exploration.
