{\color{red} A note of caution to all readers: Please keep in mind, this document is still in the process of being written and cleaned up. Everything you are reading is under active construction, so to speak.}

The aim of these notes is to draw attention to a certain simple class of category-theoretic structures which both serve as an abstract environment for the reasoning used in deriving \Loeb/'s theorem in its traditional instances, and furthermore allow this and the associated theorems and fixed-point results of the \Goedel/-\Loeb/ modal logic to be vastly generalized.

This very minimal categorical definition entails \Loeb/'s theorem and guarded recursion at both the term and type level. We also demonstrate how this abstraction offers a clean unification of the interpretation of the \Godel/-\Lob/ incompleteness theorems in traditional logic or via arithmetic universes a la Joyal, along with the interpretation by Birkedal et al of guarded recursion in presheaves over well-founded orders, along with the distinct classical interpretation of GL modal logic in well-founded transitive Kripke frames.

We also explore free instances of our structure, which turn out to admit a tractable explicit description.

It should be noted that the core of the work in this document was originally developed during my time in graduate school from 2006 to 2013, but I did not write it up suitably at that time.
