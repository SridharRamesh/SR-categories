\title{Introspective Theories and Geminal Categories}

\begin{abstract}
In provability logic, a key principle is \Loeb/'s theorem, stating that if the provability of $P$ provably entails $P$, then $P$ itself is provable (in modal notation, $\Box P \vdash P$ has as a consequence $\vdash P$). This was first discovered in the follow-up work on \Goedel/'s incompleteness theorems, with \Goedel/'s results viewable as following from \Loeb/'s theorem. Later, it was also seen that the same formal pattern of \Loeb/'s theorem described certain fixed point constructions studied under the name of \quote{guarded recursion}.

The aim of these notes is to draw attention to a certain simple class of category-theoretic structures which serve as an abstract environment for deriving \Loeb/'s theorem and such fixed point constructions, allowing for a vastly generalized and unified understanding of the scope of applicability of such constructions. These are the structures we call \quote{introspective theories}.

This very minimal categorical definition nontrivially entails \Loeb/'s theorem and guarded recursion at both the term and type level. We also demonstrate how this abstraction offers a clean unification of the interpretation of the \Godel/-\Lob/ incompleteness theorems in traditional logic or via arithmetic universes a la Joyal, along with the interpretation by Birkedal et al of guarded recursion in presheaves over well-founded orders, along with the distinct classical interpretation of the GL modal logic in well-founded transitive Kripke frames.

We also explore free instances of our structure, which turn out to admit a tractable explicit description. The free introspective theory is what we call \quote{the theory of geminal categories}, and we explore also some further illuminating relationships between the concepts of introspective theories and geminal categories.

% It should perhaps be noted that the core of the work in this document was originally developed during my time in graduate school from 2006 to 2013, but I did not write it up suitably at that time.
