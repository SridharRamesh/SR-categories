\TODOinline{If you are reading these, please keep in mind, these are still in the process of being written and cleaned up. Everything you are reading is under active construction, so to speak.}

The aim of these notes is to draw attention to a certain simple class of category-theoretic structures which both serve as an abstract environment for the reasoning used in deriving \Loeb/'s theorem in its traditional instances, and furthermore allow this and the associated theorems and fixed-point results of the \Goedel/-\Loeb/ modal logic to be vastly generalized.

This very minimal categorical definition leads to \Loeb/'s theorem and guarded recursion at both the term and type level. We also demonstrate how this abstraction offers a clean unification of the interpretation of the \Godel/-\Lob/ incompleteness theorems via arithmetic universes a la Joyal, the interpretation by Birkedal et al of guarded recursion in presheaves over well-founded orders, as well as the distinct classical interpretation of GL modal logic in well-founded transitive Kripke frames. We also explore free instances of our structure, which turn out to admit a tractable explicit description..

It should be noted that the core of the work in this document was originally developed during my time in graduate school from 2006 to 2013, but I did not write it up suitably at that time.
