\begin{abstract}
The aim of these notes is to identify and draw attention to a certain simple and categorically natural kind of mathematical structure which both serves as an abstract environment for the reasoning used in establishing \Loeb's theorem in its traditional instances, and furthermore allows this and the associated theorems and fixed-point results of the \Goedel-\Loeb\ modal logic to be vastly generalized.
