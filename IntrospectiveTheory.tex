\section{Introspective theories and GL-categories}

% Non-evil definition
\subsection{Definition}
\begin{definition} \label{DefnIntrospIndexed}
A \defined{pre-introspective theory} is a lexcategory $T$, a $T$-indexed lexcategory $C$, and a lexfunctor $F$ from the self-indexing of $T$ to $C$, like so:

\[\begin{tikzcd}
	{\op{T}} && {\LexCat}
	\arrow["{T/-}"{name=0}, from=1-1, to=1-3, shift left=2]
	\arrow["{C}"{name=1, swap}, from=1-1, to=1-3, shift right=2]
	\arrow[Rightarrow, "{F}"', from=0, to=1]
\end{tikzcd}\]

If $C$ is small or locally small, then we say this is an \defined{introspective theory} or \defined{locally introspective theory}, respectively.
\end{definition}

We write out the triple $\langle T, C, F \rangle$ to refer to a pre-introspective theory when we wish to be fully explicit about its structure. But in typical abuse of language, we also often refer to it simply by the name of its underlying lexcategory $T$, when this would not cause confusion.

\begin{construction}\label{IntrospInternalMap}
If $\langle T, C, F \rangle$ is a pre-introspective theory, and any lexfunctor $G : C \to D$ is given for some other $T$-indexed lexcategory $D$, then $\langle T, D, G \circ F \rangle$ is itself a pre-introspective theory, like so: 

\[\begin{tikzcd}
	{\op{T}} && {\LexCat}
	\arrow["{T/-}"{name=0}, from=1-1, to=1-3, shift left=5]
	\arrow["{C}"{name=1, description}, from=1-1, to=1-3]
	\arrow["{D}"{name=2, swap}, from=1-1, to=1-3, shift right=5]
	\arrow[Rightarrow, "{F}"', from=0, to=1]
	\arrow[Rightarrow, "{G}"', from=1, to=2]
\end{tikzcd}\]

Of course, this yields an introspective or locally introspective theory just in case $D$ is small or locally small, respectively.
\end{construction}

\begin{construction}\label{IntrospSlice}
If $\langle T, C, F \rangle$ is a pre-introspective theory, and $t$ is any object in $T$, then the slice category $T/t$ can be equipped in a natural way as a pre-introspective theory as well. If we start from an introspective or locally introspective theory, then so respectively will be the result of this construction.
\end{construction}
\begin{proof}[Details]
Consider the forgetful functor $\Sigma : T/t \to T$. Composition and whiskering with this gives us the triple $\langle T/t, \Sigma C, \Sigma F \rangle$, like so:

\[\begin{tikzcd}
	{\op{\left(T/t\right)}} & {\op{T}} && {\LexCat}
	\arrow["{T/-}"{name=0}, from=1-2, to=1-4, shift left=2]
	\arrow["{C}"{name=1, swap}, from=1-2, to=1-4, shift right=2]
	\arrow["{\Sigma}", from=1-1, to=1-2]
	\arrow[Rightarrow, "{F}"', from=0, to=1]
\end{tikzcd}\]

This is a pre-introspective theory as the top composite is the same as the self-indexing $(T/t)/-$ of $T/t$ (that is, slice categories within slice categories are obtained by first applying the forgetful functor into the ambient category and then taking the ordinary slice category).

When $C$ is small or locally small, then so respectively is $\Sigma C$. The representing objects for $\Sigma C$ will simply be those for $C$, mapped into $T/t$ via $\Sigma$'s right adjoint (i.e., pulled back along the unique morphism from $t$ to $1$).
\end{proof}

When we abuse language and speak of $T/t$ as an introspective theory, the above construction is what we mean. That said, there is another natural way to equip $T/t$ as an introspective theory as well.

\begin{TODOblock}
There is another way to equip $T/t$ as an introspective theory, in which we use as our internal category the slice category $C/t$ so to speak. \Cref{IntrospSlice} is actually equivalent to doing this and then applying \cref{IntrospInternalMap} to the internal forgetful lexfunctor from $C/t$ to $C$. This equivalence is easier to see once we see how the natural transformation taking $t$ to $\Hom_C(1, t)$ works.
\end{TODOblock}

We shall now make an observation about an equivalent way to define pre-introspective theories.

\begin{theorem}\label{SNCorrespondence}
Given a lexcategory $T$ and a $T$-indexed lexcategory $C$, specifying a $T$-indexed lexfunctor from the self-indexing $T/-$ to $C$ is equivalent to specifying a (non-indexed) lexfunctor $S$ from $T$ to the global aspect of $C$, as well as specifying a natural transformation from $t$ in $T$ to $\Hom_C(1, S(t))$.
\end{theorem}

As preparation for the proof of \cref{SNCorrespondence}, we will need two lemmas.

\begin{lemma}\label{Lemma1}
If T is a category with terminal object, then a map from D to C as T-indexed Xes is the same as a map S from D(1) to C(1) along with a map from D to C as T-indexed (Xes under D(1)).
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
This is completely straightforward and short. Note that the map S will be used to treat C as an X under D(1). \TODO
\end{proof}

In order to state the next lemma, some terminology: If $T$ is a lexcategory, then for each object of $t$, we can construct the free lexcategory under $T$ augmented with a global element of $t$. Call this $T[1 \to t]$. Also, for any $f : s \to t$ in $T$, we can take the generic global element of $t$ in $T[1 \to t]$ to $f$ applied to the generic global element of $s$ in $T[1 \to s]$. This action is clearly functorial. Thus, $T[1 \to -]$ comprises a $T$-indexed lexcategory under $T$. \TODOinline{Move this and \cref{Lemma2} itself to preliminaries}

\begin{lemma}\label{Lemma2}
$T[1 \to -]$ is $T/-$, as a $T$-indexed lexcategory under $T$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
This is a standard observation, and also simple enough to show. \TODO
\end{proof}

Now, we shall prove \cref{SNCorrespondence}.

\begin{proof}
We just apply \cref{Lemma1} and \cref{Lemma2} and we get our result. Let $T$ be a lexcategory, and let $C$ be some $T$-indexed lexcategory. By \cref{Lemma1}, a map from the self-indexing $T/-$ to $C$ as $T$-indexed lexcategories is the same as a lexfunctor $S$ from $T$ to the global aspect of $C$, along with a map from $T/-$ to $C$ as $T$-indexed (lexcategories under $T$). The map $S$ will be used to treat $C$ as a lexcategory under $T$.

Next we apply \cref{Lemma2}. The map from $T/-$ to $C$ as $T$-indexed (lexcategories under $T$) is the same as choosing, in a natural way over all $t$ in $T$, some $t$-defined value in $\Hom_C(1, S(t))$. That is, a natural transformation from $t$ to $\Hom_C(1, S(t))$.
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}
It wasn't fundamentally important that we were dealing with lexcategories here. \Cref{Lemma1} only required a terminal object. And for any algebraish notion extending categories-with-global-elements, there is some free construction $T[1 \to -]$. In particular, for categories-with-finite-products and for cartesian closed categories, there is also a simple independent account of the free structure $T[1 \to t]$, amounting to the full subcategory of $T/t$ on just those slices which are projections from some $t \times s$ to $t$. So we get the same result if we replace throughout ``lexcategory" and ``lexfunctor" by finite-product or cartesian-closed structure, and replace $T/-$ by this projection subcategory.
\end{remark}

As a result of \cref{SNCorrespondence}, we can give another definition equivalent to \cref{DefnIntrospIndexed}.

\begin{definition}\label{DefnIntrospSN}
A \defined{pre-introspective theory} is a lexcategory $T$, a $T$-indexed lexcategory $C$, a lexfunctor $S$ from $T$ to the global aspect of $C$, and a map $N$ from $t$ to $\Hom_C(1, S(t))$, natural in $t$ in $T$.
\end{definition}

As before, introspective or locally introspective theories are those where $C$ is small or locally small. While it is often easier to prove theorems about pre-introspective theories by using \cref{DefnIntrospIndexed}, it will usually be easier to show structures actually are pre-introspective theories by using \cref{DefnIntrospSN}. But this is not the only benefit of \cref{DefnIntrospSN}. The value of this new definition is that there is much less data around. In particular, when we wish to turn this into a lex definition in section \TODO, we will find the coherence conditions much easier to manage. It will also be easier to define the appropriate notion of homomorphisms between pre-introspective theories by thinking about \cref{DefnIntrospSN}.

\Cref{DefnIntrospSN} also allows us to quickly appreciate the significance of introspective theories from a functorial semantics point of view. An introspective theory is precisely an essentially algebraic theory (this is the role of $T$) extending the theory of lexcategories (this is the role of $C$), such that every model of the theory is equipped with a designated homomorphism (this is the role of $N$) into an internal model of the same theory (this is the role of $S$).
