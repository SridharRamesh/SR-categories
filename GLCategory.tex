\section{Geminal categories}\label{GeminalChapter}
\subsection{Preview}
In this chapter, we give an explicit yet tractably compact description of the initial introspective theory (which we call the theory of \quote{geminal categories}).

We also show the remarkable result that any strict introspective theory can itself be equipped in a natural way as a model of this initial introspective theory; that is, any strict introspective theory can be seen as a geminal category.

This last statement is easy to misinterpret, so let me be a bit more clear as to what I mean by this. I do not mean the trivial statement that every introspective theory extends the initial introspective theory. Rather, I mean that the theory of strict introspective theories extends the initial introspective theory (even though the theory of strict introspective theories is not itself an introspective theory).

We will also discuss a partial converse of sorts, a way to extract an introspective theory from a geminal category, with the extracted introspective theory having a certain terminality property (that is, we construct a sort of co-free introspective theory induced by the given geminal category).

\subsection{Strict introspective theories}
It will be technically convenient for us to work in this chapter with a slightly less \quote{presentation-free} variant of our notion of introspective theories.

\begin{definition}
A \defined{strict introspective theory} is a strict lexcategory $T$, a lexcategory $C$ internal to $T$, a strict lexfunctor $\introS$ from $T$ to the global aspect of $C$, and a natural transformation $\introN$ from $\id_T$ to $\Hom_C(1, \introS(-))$.
\end{definition}

As usual, to name a strict introspective theory, we can enumerate the entire ordered tuple $\langle T, C, \introS, \introN \rangle$, or sometimes we just note $\langle T, C \rangle$ or $T$ explicitly and leave the rest implicit.

The definition of a strict introspective theory differs from the definition of an ordinary introspective theory (\magicref{DefnIntrospSN}) in the following ways: $T$ is made strict (thus, its internal structures can be considered up to equality instead of mere isomorphism), we demand the selection of $C$ as a particular $T$-internal lexcategory up to equality (instead of simply up to presenting equivalent indexed categories), and we take $\introS$ as a strict lexfunctor (thus, $\introS$ preserves chosen basis limits on-the-nose).

Clearly, any strict introspective theory presents some introspective theory. Conversely, we have the following:

\begin{theorem}\label{StrictifyingIntrosp}
Any introspective theory $\langle T, C, \introS, \introN \rangle$ is presented by some strict introspective theory.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
Suppose given an introspective theory $\langle T, C, \introS, \introN \rangle$. By definition of the smallness of $C$, we can choose some lexcategory $C_{int}$ internal to $T$ (up to isomorphism of indexed strict lexcategories) which presents the $T$-indexed category $C$ (up to equivalence of indexed categories).

Now using \TODO, let $T_{strict}$ be some strict lexcategory which presents $T$ and which has the freeness property that \TODO. Because $T'$ presents $T$, we can choose some specific internal lexcategory $C_{strict}$ in $T_{strict}$ (up to equality!) which presents $C_{int}$. Because $C_{strict}$ presents $C_{int}$ which in turn presents $C$, $\introS$ can be viewed as a (non-strict) lexfunctor from $T$ to the global aspect of $C_{strict}$. Now using the freeness property of $T_{strict}$, we obtain a strict lexfunctor $\introS_{strict}$ from $T_{strict}$ to the global aspect of $C_{strict}$, such that $\introS_{strict}$ presents $\introS$.

Finally, we deal with $\introN$. Natural transformations are essentially unaffected by strictness considerations. That is, given parallel strict functors $A_{strict}$ and $B_{strict}$, natural transformations between these are in bijection with natural transformations between the non-strict functors these present. So our original $\introN$ corresponds to a unique natural transformation between the identity on $T_{strict}$ and $\Hom_{C_{strict}}(1, \introS_{strict}(-))$.

Thus, we have obtained a strict introspective theory $\langle T_{strict}, C_{strict}, \introS_{strict}, \introN \rangle$ presenting the introspective theory $\langle T, C, \introS, \introN \rangle$.
\end{proof}

Strict introspective theories are slightly more convenient than introspective theories for phrasing the results of this chapter, because strict introspective theories are themselves an essentially algebraic notion. That is, there is an essentially algebraic theory such that the models of this theory are the strict introspective theories. (This is in precisely the same way that the theory of strict categories is essentially algebraic, while the theory of categories construed up to equivalence is not quite essentially algebraic.)

As with any essentially algebraic theory, we get automatically a corresponding notion of homomorphism.

\begin{definition}\label{StrictIntrospHomoDefn}
A \defined{homomorphism} between strict introspective theories $\langle T_1, C_1, \introS, \introN \rangle$ and $\langle T_2, C_2, \introS, \introN \rangle$ is a strict lexfunctor $H : T_1 \to T_2$ such that $H[C_1] = C_2$, $H[\introN_t] = \introN_{H(t)}$ for each object $t$ of $T_1$, and the following diagram commutes:

% https://q.uiver.app/?q=WzAsNCxbMCwwLCJUXzEiXSxbMiwwLCJUXzIiXSxbMCwxLCJcXEdsb2J7Q18xfSJdLFsyLDEsIlxcR2xvYntDXzJ9Il0sWzAsMSwiSCJdLFswLDIsIlxcaW50cm9TIiwyXSxbMiwzLCJcXEluZHVjZWRIb21ve0h9e0NfMX0iLDJdLFsxLDMsIlxcaW50cm9TIl1d

	\arrow["{\InducedHomo{H}{C_1}}"', from=2-1, to=2-3]
	\arrow["\introS", from=1-3, to=2-3]
\end{tikzcd}\]

In the above diagram, the bottom arrow indicates the action of $H$ as a homomorphism from the global aspect of the $T_1$-internal structure $C_1$, to the global aspect of the corresponding $T_2$-internal structure $H[C_1] = C_2$.
\end{definition}

Such homomorphisms are closed under composition and thus we obtain the category of strict introspective theories.

As the category of models of an essentially algebraic theory, this category must have an initial object. That is, there is a strict introspective theory with a unique homomorphism into any other strict introspective theory. In this chapter, we will find a tractable explicit description of this initial strict introspective theory.

\subsection{Defining geminal categories}
We make heavy use in this section of the conventions from \magicref{MultiplyInternal}, with which the reader may wish to reacquaint themselves.

\begin{definition}[Geminal category]\label{VerboseGeminalCatDefn}
A \defined{geminal category} internal to lexcategory $C_0$ consists of several ingredients:

\begin{itemize}
    \item 
    The first ingredient is an infinite sequence $C_1, C_2, C_3, \ldots$, in which each $C_i$ (for $i \geq 1$) is the global aspect of a lexcategory $C'_i$ internal to $C_{i - 1}$.
\end{itemize}

Thus, each $C'_{i + n}$ is $n$-tuply internal to $C_i$.

(Throughout the following, it will be useful to keep in mind that we are using these general naming habits: Primed names are used for internal structures, while the corresponding unprimed names indicate the corresponding global aspects. Furthermore, names subscripted with index $i$ arise from structure internal to $C_{i - 1}$.)

\begin{itemize}
    \item
    The second ingredient comprising a geminal category is an infinite sequence of internal lexfunctors $F'_1, F'_2, F'_3, \ldots$, where each $F'_i : C'_i \to \Gamma[C'_{i + 1}]$ is internal to $C_{i - 1}$ (for $i \geq 1$).
\end{itemize}

Pictorially, this can be envisioned like so: 

% https://q.uiver.app/?q=WzAsMTEsWzEsMCwiQydfMSJdLFsyLDAsIlxcR2FtbWFbQydfMl0iXSxbMiwxLCJDJ18yIl0sWzMsMSwiXFxHYW1tYVtDJ18zXSJdLFswLDAsIkNfMDoiXSxbMCwxLCJDXzE6Il0sWzAsMiwiQ18yOiJdLFszLDIsIkMnXzMiXSxbNCwyLCJcXEdhbW1hW0MnXzRdIl0sWzAsMywiXFxsZG90cyJdLFs0LDMsIlxcbGRvdHMiXSxbMCwxLCJGJ18xIl0sWzIsMywiRidfMiJdLFs3LDgsIkYnXzMiXSxbNSw0LCJcXEdhbW1hIl0sWzYsNSwiXFxHYW1tYSJdLFs5LDYsIlxcR2FtbWEiXV0=
\[\begin{tikzcd}
	{C_0:} & {C'_1} & {\Gamma[C'_2]} \\
	{C_1:} && {C'_2} & {\Gamma[C'_3]} \\
	{C_2:} &&& {C'_3} & {\Gamma[C'_4]} \\
	\ldots &&&& \ldots
	\arrow["{F'_1}", from=1-2, to=1-3]
	\arrow["{F'_2}", from=2-3, to=2-4]
	\arrow["{F'_3}", from=3-4, to=3-5]
	\arrow["\Gamma", from=2-1, to=1-1]
	\arrow["\Gamma", from=3-1, to=2-1]
	\arrow["\Gamma", from=4-1, to=3-1]
\end{tikzcd}\]

Here, the first row is structure internal to $C_0$, the second row is structure internal to $C_1$ (thus, doubly internal to the ambient $C_0$), the third row is structure internal to $C_2$ (thus, triply internal to the ambient $C_0$), and so on.

In keeping with our convention, we shall also use $F_i : C_i \to C_{i + 1}$ to refer to the global aspect of $F'_i$. These global aspects line up more straightforwardly:

% https://q.uiver.app/?q=WzAsNCxbMCwwLCJDXzEiXSxbMSwwLCJDXzIiXSxbMiwwLCJDXzMiXSxbMywwLCJcXGxkb3RzIl0sWzAsMSwiRl8xIl0sWzEsMiwiRl8yIl0sWzIsMywiRl8zIl1d

	\arrow["{F_2}", from=1-2, to=1-3]
	\arrow["{F_3}", from=1-3, to=1-4]
\end{tikzcd}\]

Finally, the last ingredients we require are some equations:

\begin{itemize}
    \item 
     We require that $F_i[C'_j] = C'_{j + 1}$ and $F_i[F'_j] = F'_{j + 1}$ for $j > i \geq 1$.
     
    \item
    Furthermore, we require that the following diagram of lexfunctors internal to $C_{i - 1}$ commutes, for each $i \geq 1$. We call this equation $E_i$.
    
% https://q.uiver.app/?q=WzAsNCxbMCwwLCJDJ19pIl0sWzAsMiwiXFxHYW1tYSBbQydfe2kgKyAxfV0iXSxbMiwyLCJcXEdhbW1hIFtcXEdhbW1hW0MnX3tpICsgMn1dXSJdLFsyLDAsIlxcR2FtbWEgW0MnX3tpICsgMX1dIl0sWzAsMSwiRidfaSIsMl0sWzAsMywiRidfaSJdLFszLDIsIlxcR2FtbWEgW0YnX3tpICsgMX1dIl0sWzEsMiwiXFxJbmR1Y2VkSG9tb3tGJ19pfXtDJ197aSArIDF9fSIsMl1d
\[\begin{tikzcd}

	\\

	\arrow["{F'_i}"', from=1-1, to=3-1]
	\arrow["{F'_i}", from=1-1, to=1-3]
	\arrow["{\Gamma [F'_{i + 1}]}", from=1-3, to=3-3]
	\arrow["{\InducedHomo{F'_i}{C'_{i + 1}}}"', from=3-1, to=3-3]
\end{tikzcd}\]

That is, we require that $\InducedHomo{F'_i}{C'_{i + 1}} \circ F'_i = \Gamma[F'_{i + 1}] \circ F'_i$. This could be naively glossed as \quote{$F'_i \circ F'_i = F'_{i + 1} \circ F'_i$}, in severe abuse of notation.
\end{itemize}

This concludes the definition of a geminal category internal to $C_0$.
\end{definition}

By a \defined{geminal category} simpliciter, we mean of course the case where $C_0 = \Set$. (Note that in this case, $C'_1$ can be identified with its global aspect $C_1$, in the same way that any structure internal to $\Set$ can be identified with its global aspect, as the global sections functor from $\Set$ to $\Set$ is the identity.). We wrote out here the definition for general $C_0$, instead of specifically for $C_0 = \Set$, in order to emphasize certain symmetries in this definition.

When being fully explicit, we reference a geminal category by enumerating $\langle C'_1, C'_2, C'_3, \ldots; F'_1, F'_2, F'_3, \ldots \rangle$. Given such a geminal category $K$, we may write $|K|$ to refer to its underlying lexcategory $C'_1$.

All aforementioned structure apart from $C_0$ itself has been given as $i$-tuply internal to $C_0$ for some $i > 0$. Thus, all of this structure is indeed given by diagrams within $C_0$.

Indeed, this definition of geminal category is manifestly essentially algebraic. That is, there is an essentially algebraic theory such that models of that theory internal to $C_0$ are the same thing as geminal categories internal to $C_0$.

Our ultimate goal will be to show that this theory of geminal categories is the initial introspective theory. This is the whole motivation for our study of geminal categories. But to show this result, we must develop some other machinery first.

\subsection{Geminal category homomorphisms}
As geminal categories are defined by an essentially algebraic theory, we automatically get a notion of homomorphism between geminal categories. It amounts to the following:

\begin{definition}\label{VerboseGeminalCatHomoDefn}
Given two geminal categories $\langle C'_1, C'_2, C'_3, \ldots; F'_1, F'_2, F'_3, \ldots \rangle$ and $\langle D'_1, D'_2, $ $D'_3, \ldots; \phi'_1, \phi'_2, \phi'_3, \ldots \rangle$, a \defined{homomorphism} from the former to the latter consists of a strict lexfunctor $H : C'_1 \to D'_1$ such that $H[C'_i] = D'_i$ and $H[F'_i] = \phi'_i$ for each $i > 1$, while also the following diagram commutes:

% https://q.uiver.app/?q=WzAsNCxbMCwwLCJDJ18xIl0sWzIsMCwiRCdfMSJdLFsyLDIsIlxcR2xvYntIW0MnXzJdfSA9IFxcR2xvYntEXzInfSJdLFswLDIsIlxcR2xvYntDXzInfSJdLFswLDEsIkgiXSxbMCwzLCJGJ18xIiwyXSxbMywyLCJcXEluZHVjZWRIb21ve0h9e0MnXzJ9IiwyXSxbMSwyLCJcXHBoaSdfMSJdXQ==
\[\begin{tikzcd}
	{C'_1} && {D'_1} \\
	\\
	{\Glob{C_2'}} && {\Glob{H[C'_2]} = \Glob{D_2'}}
	\arrow["H", from=1-1, to=1-3]
	\arrow["{F'_1}"', from=1-1, to=3-1]
	\arrow["{\InducedHomo{H}{C'_2}}"', from=3-1, to=3-3]
	\arrow["{\phi'_1}", from=1-3, to=3-3]
\end{tikzcd}\]
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}\label{GeminalContainsGeminal}
Given any geminal category $K = \langle C'_1, C'_2, C'_3, \ldots; F'_1, F'_2, F'_3, \ldots \rangle$, we have also that $\langle C'_2, C'_3, C'_4, \ldots; F'_2, F'_3, F'_4 \ldots \rangle$ comprises a geminal category internal to $|K| = C'_1$. We refer to this internal geminal category as $\InteriorGeminal{K}$.

We furthermore have that $F'_1$ acts as a geminal category homomorphism from $K$ to the global aspect of $\InteriorGeminal{K}$. We refer to this homomorphism as $\IntoSelf{K} : K \to \Gamma[\InteriorGeminal{K}]$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
This is all direct by definition.

For the first part, each condition imposed upon each $C'_{i}$ or $F'_{i}$ in the definition of a geminal category comes with an analogous condition imposed upon $C'_{i + 1}$ or $F'_{i + 1}$. Thus, it is immediate that the given $\InteriorGeminal{K}$ satisfies the conditions to be a geminal category internal to $|K|$.

For the second part, the definition of a geminal category directly imposes upon $F'_1$ precisely the conditions which are necessary for $F'_1$ to comprise a geminal category homomorphism from $K$ to the global aspect of $\InteriorGeminal{K}$. In particular, equation $E_1$ from \magicref{VerboseGeminalCatDefn} is identical to the commutative diagram from \magicref{VerboseGeminalCatHomoDefn}, in this context.
\end{proof}

Via the yoga of functorial semantics, \magicref{GeminalContainsGeminal} states how the theory of geminal categories can be equipped as an introspective theory. In detail, this is given like so:

\begin{construction}\label{GLCatTheoryIsIntrosp}
Let $\GLCatTheory$ be the free strict lexcategory with an internal geminal category (that is, in the terminology of \magicref{QuasiTheoryTheory}, we take $\GLCatTheory$ to be the classifying strict lexcategory $\classifying{\theoryT}$, where $\theoryT$ is the theory of geminal categories). 

Thus, strict lexfunctors from $\GLCatTheory$ to any other strict lexcategory $D$ correspond to geminal categories internal to $D$, while natural transformations between such lexfunctors correspond to homomorphisms between these $D$-internal geminal categories.

Let $K$ denote the $\GLCatTheory$-internal geminal category corresponding to the identity functor on $\GLCatTheory$.

By \magicref{GeminalContainsGeminal} in the internal logic of $\GLCatTheory$, we obtain also a geminal category $\InteriorGeminal{K}$ internal to $|K|$, as well as a homomorphism $\IntoSelf{K} : K \to \Gamma[\InteriorGeminal{K}]$.

Thus, there is some strict lexfunctor $\introS$ from $\GLCatTheory$ to the global aspect of $|K|$, corresponding to $\InteriorGeminal{K}$. Furthermore, there is some natural transformation $\introN$ from the identity functor on $\GLCatTheory$ to $\Hom_{|K|}(1, \introS(-))$, corresponding to $\IntoSelf{K}$.

Putting this together, we have a strict introspective theory $\langle \GLCatTheory, |K|, \introS, \introN \rangle$.
\end{construction}

\sTODOinline{Note that there is a more limited analogue of the above, where we observe that the free X with an internal geminal Y is itself a geminal X, whenever Y extends X and X extends the notion of a lexcategory. The difficulty with turning this into an introspective theory is that the property we really depend on from the free lexcategory $L$ with an internal gadget of some sort is not just the 1-categorical property that it has a unique homomorphism to every other gadget, but the 2-categorical property that the category of homomorphisms from it to another lexcategory and natural transformations between those is equivalent to the 1-category of internal gadgets within that codomain lexcategory. This is true for lexcategories, but not necessarily for other doctrines, and I believe this is related to how $\Hom(1, -)$ is always a lexfunctor (thus turning internal models into genuine models,) but not always an X-functor. The subtle role of this in the above proof should be highlighted.}

\subsection{Compactly defined geminal categories}
The above all amounts to an infinitary presentation of the theory of geminal categories. For this reason, we call it the \quote{verbose presentation} of geminal categories. However, it turns out this same theory can be finitely axiomatized as well.

\begin{definition}[Geminal category, compact presentation]\label{CompactGeminalCatDefn}
A \defined{compactly presented geminal category} internal to lexcategory $C_0$ consists of the structure $C'_i$, $F'_i$, and equations $E_i$ of the verbose presentation, but only for $i \in \{1, 2\}$.

(Here, in interpreting the codomain of $F'_2$, we take $C'_3$ to be $F_1[C'_2]$, and in interpreting the equation $E_2$, we take $F'_3$ to be $F_1[F'_2]$)

That is, a compactly presented geminal category internal to $C_0$ consists of the following six pieces of data:

\begin{itemize}
    \item A lexcategory $C'_1$ internal to $C_0$, whose global aspect we call $C_1$.
    
    \item A lexcategory $C'_2$ internal to $C_1$, whose global aspect we call $C_2$.
    
    \item A lexfunctor $F'_1 : C'_1 \to \Gamma[C'_2]$, internal to $C_0$. We call the global aspect of this $F_1 : C_1 \to C_2$.
    
    \item A lexfunctor $F'_2 : C'_2 \to \Gamma[C'_3]$, internal to $C_1$.
    
    (Here, $C'_3$ is defined as $F_1[C'_2]$.)
    
    \item The equation $\InducedHomo{F'_1}{C'_{2}} \circ F'_1 = \Gamma[F'_2] \circ F'_1$, internal to $C_0$. We call this equation $E_1$.
    
    \item The equation $\InducedHomo{F'_2}{C'_{3}} \circ F'_2 = \Gamma[F'_3] \circ F'_2$, internal to $C_1$. We call this equation $E_2$.
    
    (Here, $F'_3$ is defined as $F_1[F'_2]$.)
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

As usual, we reference a compactly presented geminal category by enumerating the ordered tuple $\langle C'_1, C'_2; F'_1, F'_2 \rangle$.

Clearly, the structure defining a compactly presented geminal category is part of the structure in our verbose definition of a geminal category. But in fact, these are equivalent definitions.

\begin{theorem}\label{GeminalCompactIsVerbose}
The structure of a compactly presented geminal category uniquely determines the further structure of a geminal category (as originally defined in \magicref{VerboseGeminalCatDefn})).
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
By definition, in a geminal category, we must have that $F_1[C'_j] = C'_{j + 1}$ and $F_1[F'_j] = F'_{j + 1}$ for each $j > 2$.

Accordingly, if we are given the structure in \magicref{CompactGeminalCatDefn}, and we are to extend it to all the further structure in \magicref{VerboseGeminalCatDefn}, it inductively must be the case that $C'_j = F_1^{j - 2}[C'_2]$ and $F'_j = F_1^{j - 2}[F'_2]$ for each $j > 2$. Adopt these definitions throughout the following accordingly.

The equations given to us directly in the compact presentation are the equations $E_1$ and $E_2$ of the verbose presentation. Furthermore, we obtain the equation $E_i$ for $i > 2$ by applying $F_1^{n - 1}$ to $E_2$.

What remains is only to see that each $F_i$ for $i > 1$ also takes $C'_j$ to $C'_{j + 1}$ and takes $F'_j$ to $F'_{j + 1}$, for $j > i \geq 1$.

We prove this by induction on $i$. For the base case of $i = 1$, we have ensured this by construction. As for the inductive step, suppose we know this already holds for $i$. Then $F_{i + 1}[C'_j] = F_{i + 1} [F_i [C'_{j - 1}]] = F_i [F_i [C'_{j - 1}]] = F_i [C'_j] = C'_{j + 1}$, where the second step is by $E_i$ \TODO and the other steps are by our induction hypothesis. And similarly with $F'$ in place of $C'$ throughout as well.
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}\label{CompactGeminalCatHomoDefn}
In \magicref{VerboseGeminalCatHomoDefn}, the conditions $H[C'_i] = D'_i$ and $H[F'_i] = \phi'_i$ automatically follow for all $i > 2$ once they hold for $i = 2$.
\end{corollary}

Thus, we can go back and forth between thinking of geminal categories in either the verbose or compact presentation as we please, whichever is most convenient at any moment.

\subsection{Geminal categories from introspective theories}

\begin{construction}\label{IntrospAsGeminal}
From a strict introspective theory $\langle T, C, \introS, \introN \rangle$, we obtain a geminal category $\langle T, C; \introS, \introN_{C} \rangle$, whose underlying lexcategory is $T$. This is the canonical way to view an introspective theory as a geminal category.
\end{construction}
\begin{proof}
It is immediate in the definition of a strict introspective theory that $C$ is a lexcategory internal to $T$ and $\introS : T \to \Glob{C}$. This gives us the first three out of the six ingredients of \magicref{CompactGeminalCatDefn}.

As for $\introN_{C}$, meaning the components of the natural transformation $\introN$ at the objects of $C$, this gives us a $T$-internal lexfunctor from $C$ to $\Hom_C(1, \introS[C]) = \Gamma[\introS[C]]$. This is the fourth ingredient of \magicref{CompactGeminalCatDefn}.

What remains are to verify equations $E_1$ and $E_2$. In this context, $E_1$ is a special case of \magicref{SMatchesN}, while $E_2$ is given by the naturality of $\introN$ with respect to the components of $\introN_C$ themselves.
\end{proof}

There is another closely related construction which is of even more importance:

\begin{construction}\label{IntrospContainsGeminal}
From a strict introspective theory $\langle T, C, \introS, \introN \rangle$, we obtain a $T$-internal geminal category $\langle C, \introS[C]; \introN_{C}, \introS[\introN_{C}] \rangle$, whose underlying lexcategory is $C$.
\end{construction}
\begin{proof}
This is the result of first obtaining the geminal category $\gamma = \langle T, C, \introS, \introN_C \rangle$ from \magicref{IntrospAsGeminal}, and then forming $\InteriorGeminal{\gamma}$.
\end{proof}

We now are ready to prove our main result about geminal categories.

\subsection{The free introspective theory}
\begin{theorem}
The strict introspective theory given in \magicref{GLCatTheoryIsIntrosp} is the initial strict introspective theory.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
We must show there is a unique homomorphism from the strict introspective theory $\langle \GLCatTheory, K \rangle$ of \magicref{GLCatTheoryIsIntrosp} to any other strict introspective theory $\langle T, D, \introS, \introN \rangle$.

Such a homomorphism is comprised of a strict lexfunctor $H : \GLCatTheory \to T$ satisfying certain conditions. By the nature of $\GLCatTheory$, this amounts to a geminal category $\langle D'_1, D'_2, D'_3, \ldots; F'_1, F'_2, F'_3, \ldots \rangle$ internal to $T$ satisfying certain conditions.

One particular geminal category internal to $T$ is the one that is given by $\gamma = \langle D, \introS[D]; \introN_D, \introS[\introN_D] \rangle$, as noted at \magicref{IntrospContainsGeminal}. In verbose terms, this geminal category is $\langle D, \introS[D], \introS[\introS[D]], \ldots;$ $ \introN_D, \introS[\introN_D], \introS[\introS[\introN_D]], \ldots \rangle$, with each successive component being $\introS$ applied to the previous component.

What remains is to show that the lexfunctor $H : \GLCatTheory \to T$ corresponding to this $\gamma$ uniquely satisfies the conditions of \magicref{StrictIntrospHomoDefn}.

The condition $H[C'_1] = D$ in \magicref{StrictIntrospHomoDefn} says in this context that we must use a geminal category whose underlying lexcategory is $D$.

The condition concerning $\introN$ in \magicref{StrictIntrospHomoDefn}, along with the definition of $\introN$ in \magicref{GLCatTheoryIsIntrosp}, says that we must use a geminal category whose first lexfunctor component is $\introN_{D}$.

Finally, the commutative diagram concerning $\introS$ in \magicref{StrictIntrospHomoDefn}, along with the definition of $\introS$ in \magicref{GLCatTheoryIsIntrosp}, says we must use a geminal category such that each successive component of this geminal category is $\introS$ applied to the previous component.

The conjunction of these conditions clearly is uniquely satisfied by $\gamma$. This completes the proof.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Geminal gadgets}
We have now successfully described the initial introspective theory. But we can also take our free construction results a bit further than this.

Specifically, every introspective theory is, among other things, an essentially algebraic theory extending the theory of strict lexcategories. That is, we have a functor from the category of introspective theories to the category of extensions of the essentially algebraic theory of strict lexcategories (essentially, this functor takes $\langle T, C, \introS, \introN \rangle$ to $\langle T, C \rangle$). This functor has a left adjoint.

Put in other words, for any essentially algebraic theory $Th$ such that models of $Th$ come with an underlying strict lexcategory, there is a free strict introspective theory $\langle T, C, \introS, \introN \rangle$ with a designated $T$-internal model of $Th$ with underlying lexcategory $C$.

For simplicity as a first introduction, everything done previously was the special case where $Th$ was simply the theory of strict lexcategories itself. But now we describe the more general results, which follow by almost exactly the same reasoning as used before:

\TODOinline{Now we can duplicate all of the above, except for the result that introspective theories are themselves geminal categories, for \quote{geminal gadgets} more generally. That is, the left adjoint mentioned above is given by a general construction perfectly analogous to the one we used to construct the concept of geminal categories above.}

\subsection{Co-free introspective theories}
\begin{TODOblock}
Write out how we can sort of re-extract from a geminal category $C$ some introspective theories which may have given rise to it, or something like the initial and terminal introspective theories which may have given rise to it, the latter meaning something like the category of morphisms m : X -> []X within $C$ such that []m = J: []X -> [][]X, and the former meaning either the theory of geminal categories itself or the free lex theory with an internal model of $C$. There's some profunctors/adjunctions between introspective theories and geminal categories to consider here.

Actually, I believe this is what we should look at: Consider a geminal category $\langle G, G'\rangle$ living internally to ambient lexcategory $S$.

Then we can make an introspective theory $T$ whose objects are quadruples $\langle s, g, a, b \rangle$ where $s$ is an object of $S$, $g$ is a globally defined object of $G$, $a : s \to \Hom_G(1, g)$ is a morphism of $S$, and $b$ is a global element of $\Hom_G(g, \Hom_G'(1, \introN_G g))$, such that the following diagram commutes:

	s && {\Hom_G(1, g)} \\

	{\Hom_G(1, g)} && {\Hom_G(1, \Hom_{G'}(1, \introN_G g))}
	\arrow["a"', from=1-1, to=3-1]
	\arrow["a", from=1-1, to=1-3]
	\arrow["{b \circ -}", from=1-3, to=3-3]
	\arrow["{\introN_G}"', from=3-1, to=3-3]
\end{tikzcd}\].

This corresponds to the naturality square for $\introN$ as applied to itself. $a$ is meant to be a component of $\introN$, and $b$ is $\introS(a)$, with $g$ similarly as $\introS(s)$. So to speak.

A morphism between two such objects is a pair $\langle m : s_1 \to s_2 \in S, n : g_1 \to g_2 \in G$ such that the following commutes:

Check that this really does yield a lexcategory. Limits are probably taken component-wise everywhere. Indeed, this appears to be some kind of iterated comma category.

That defines $T$. Within $T$, how do we define $C$? Well, for example, $\Ob(C)$ is the quadruple $\langle \Ob(G), \Ob(G'), \introN_G, \introN'_{G'} \rangle$ and so on for $\Mor(C)$ and everything else. This probably works out, write out the tedious details.

Now, how do we define $\introS$? Well, for its action on objects, for any quadruple $\langle s, g, a, b \rangle$, you can take it to $\langle g, \introN_G g, b, \introN_G b\rangle$; similarly, for its action on morphisms, for any pair $\langle m, n\rangle$, you can take it to $\langle n, \introN_G n \rangle$.

Finally, how do we define $\introN$? Well, for its component at $\langle s, g, a, b \rangle$, we define the morphism to be given by $\langle a, b \rangle$. Check that the naturality and everything works.

And how do we map this introspective theory into $S$ to re-yield our original geminal gadget? Send $\langle s, g, a, b \rangle$ to $s$, and send $\langle m, n \rangle$ to $m$.

For any other introspective theory $\langle T', C' \rangle$ giving rise to $G$ via lexfunctor $M$ into $S$, we obtain a lexfunctor from $T'$ to $T$ which sends object $t$ in $T'$ to $\langle M(t), M(\introS(t)), M(\introN_t), M(\introS(\introN_t))\rangle$ and sends morphism $m$ in $T'$ to $\langle M(m), M(\introS(m))\rangle$. This will act as an introspective theory homomorphism.

\subsection{Don't read beyond here}
\TODOinline{Everything following in this chapter is about to get thrown out/rewritten}

\begin{TODOblock}
Note that the above means every geminal gadget is the carrier of a coalgebra for a particular endofunctor on geminal gadgets. Those gadgets for which this coalgebra is an isomorphism are of particular note (as related to GLS modal logic and not just GL modal logic). We can also iterate transfinitely and take a colimit (usually just an omega-colimit for finitary notions of gadget), i.e. apply Adamek's construction, to reflect arbitrary geminal gadgets into these GLS geminal gadgets. See the section on well-pointed endofunctors at "transfinite construction of free algebras" on nlab, or "A unified treatment of transfinite constructions for free algebras, free monoids, colimits, associated sheaves, and so on.". Keep in mind that the relevant endofunctor is indeed well-pointed, by the properties of geminal categories. Keep in mind, this infinitary colimit reflection can be carried out for geminal categories internal to $\Set$, given $\Set$'s sufficient infinitary colimit structure; we do not have a guarantee that a geminal category internal to an arbitrary lexcategory can be reflected into a GLS category.

Actually, none of this is specific to geminal gadgets (models of free introspective theories). It applies to models of any introspective theory. (Although maybe we don't actually have well-pointedness here in general?)

It may be curious to consider in what cases an introspective theory is itself GLS-geminal like so. Many natural examples do have this property (the $\Sigma_1$ introspective theory with internal $\Sigma_1$ C for a sound theory like PA, the topos of trees with step operator, the initial arithmetic universe, etc). These will generally also be "super-introspective theories" in the terminology of the TODO note at the end of this section.
\end{TODOblock}

There are analogues of all the above results where we use finite product theories instead, and talk about enriched structures rather than internal structures. This can be made to work because finite product structure suffices to discuss enriched category structure and even enriched category-with-finite-product structure once the structure of the objects themselves has been fixed. We decline for now to formalize this, as it is a bit off the path of our main interest in introspective theories. \TODOinline{Formalize this, as free locally introspective theories (consider both the finite limit and finite product cases) unify this with the above, show how Kripke-4 categories are the enriched analogue of a geminal cartesian closed category. Note how a geminal lex cartesian closed category always gives rise to such an enriched-geminal cartesian closed category. Discuss the weaker notion of enriched-geminal categories which do not presume cartesian closed structure as well, and note how any geminal category gives rise to such an enriched-geminal category.}

\begin{TODOblock}
Observe that geminal categories differ importantly from introspective theories because we do not have X |- []X for arbitrary objects in a geminal category, like we do in an introspective theory. Observe that we do have Loeb's theorem for representable presheaves in any geminal category, just from the fact that we have it as a claim about $C$ within any introspective theory, even for these objects which do not satisfy X |- []X. And similarly for certain functorial fixed points. (Write this intuition about how geminal categories differ from introspective theories most notably wrt to the X |- []X presumption into the introductory section.)

But a geminal category in itself does not give us the structure to talk about presheaves or functors of a sort not definable for, well, a generic geminal category, and so we do not get Loeb's theorem or fixed points for arbitrary presheaves or functors. (It is worth observing this specific failure with an example.)
\end{TODOblock}

\begin{TODOblock}
Write out that Geminal Ys are the same as Geminal (Geminal Y)s. More to the point, (geminal Ys)-extending-X, for a specific geminal Y structure called X, are the same as geminal (Geminal-Ys-extending-X).

Thus, every specific geminal structure (for one kind of gadget) is an initial geminal structure (for another kind of gadget).

One consequence of this is that every geminal structure indeed arises as the global aspect of some gadget-with-underlying-category C internal to some introspective theory (as it is easy, essentially tautological, to see that the free geminal gadget is the one which arises as the global sections of the introspective theory of geminal gadgets).
\end{TODOblock}

\begin{TODOblock}
Discuss \quote{super-introspective} theories: Introspective theories whose internal category is equipped not just as a geminal category but furthermore as an introspective theory, and satisfying the coherence axiom that for any X, when you internalize the map from X to []X, you get the internal introspective theory's map from (internalization of X) to [](internalization of X). Note that this is a kind of well-pointedness condition.

These are the same as geminal introspective theories such that the two underlying geminal category structures (from being a geminal X and from being an introspective theory) coincide.

An example is given by the first part of \cref{SigmaModelSimple}, before we extend the internal copy to be more than just $\Sigma_1$. When the internal copy is restricted to $\Sigma_1$ formulas, it is not merely geminal but furthermore canonically introspective, in a matching way with the outer introspective structure.
\end{TODOblock}

\TODOinline{Note that if the theory of gadgets is finitely presentable, then so is the theory of geminal gadgets}

\TODOinline{Note that the slice introspective theory construction gives us the free augmentation of an introspective theory with a global element of a particular object}

\subsection{Detritus to maybe delete}
The significance of our constellation of constructions turning introspective theories into geminal categories may be further illuminated by thinking about box notation for geminal categories.

\begin{definition}\label{BoxForGeminal}
Given a geminal category $\langle C'_1, C'_2; F'_1, F'_2 \rangle$, we may define a bifunctor on $C'_1$ like so: Given objects $c$ and $d$ in $C'_1$, we define $\Box(c \implies d)$ to mean $\Hom_{C'_2}(F'_1(c), F'_1(d))$. We then take $\Box d$ as shorthand for $\Box(1 \implies d)$.
\end{definition}

This is reminiscent of our previously introduced box notation for introspective theories (where we had both $\Box_T$ and $\Box_C$). And indeed, we will now link all of these box notations:

\begin{observation}
Given an introspective theory $\langle T, C, \introS, \introN \rangle$, if we think of this as a geminal category with underlying lexcategory $T$ via \magicref{IntrospAsGeminal} and then apply the box notation from \magicref{BoxForGeminal}, we find that for $t, s \in T$, we have $\Box(s \implies t) = \Hom_C(\introS(s), \introS(t))$, and in particular, $\Box t = \Hom_C(1, \introS(t))$. This exactly matches the definition of $\Box_T t$ used for introspective theories from \magicref{BoxDefn}.

Alternatively, if we use \magicref{IntrospContainsGeminal} to obtain a $T$-internal geminal category with underlying lexcategory $C$, and then apply the box notation from \magicref{BoxForGeminal}, we find that for $c, d \in C$, we have $\Box(c \implies d) = \Hom_{\introS[C]}(\introN_{\Ob(c)}(c), \introN_{\Ob(c)}(d))$. When $c$ and $d$ are globally defined, we can use \magicref{SMatchesN} to show this equal to $\Hom_{\introS[C]}(\introS(c), \introS(d)) =  \introS(\Hom_C(c, d))$. This exactly matches the definition of $\Box_C (c \implies d)$ used with introspective theories from \magicref{BoxDefn}.

\TODOinline{When $c$ and $d$ are not globally defined, then what?}
\end{observation}
