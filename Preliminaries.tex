\section{Preliminaries}

\subsection{Terminology pedantry}
We speak in the following frequently of category-valued presheaves (i.e., contravariant functors into the category of categories) and natural transformations between these. Technically, what we mean by these are not \quote{functors} and \quote{natural transformations} in the traditional sense, but what some call "pseudofunctors" and \quote{pseudonatural transformations}, or \quote{2-functors} and \quote{2-natural transformations}, as the category of categories should be viewed as a 2-category, lacking a notion of equality and only having a notion of isomorphism between its 1-cells. That is, wherever one might traditionally ask for an (automatically coherent) system of equalities, this is replaced by a coherent system of isomorphisms. We take the convention that this is what terminology such as \quote{functor} and \quote{natural transformation} already means. But we will construct all arguments in such a way as that none of this is a bother that needs to be explicitly worried about. 

\subsection{Indexed, small, and locally small structures}
We assume familiarity with sets, functions, categories, functors, categories having finite limits (i.e., lexcategories), functors preserving finite limits (i.e., lexfunctors), natural transformations, presheaves, etc, all in the ordinary sense.

Let $T$ be an arbitrary category. By a \defined{$T$-indexed set}, we mean a presheaf on $T$; that is, a contravariant functor from $T$ to $\Set$. By a \defined{function} or \defined{map} or any such thing between $T$-indexed sets, we mean a natural transformation between the corresponding presheaves.

We say an indexed set is \defined{small} if the corresponding presheaf is representable. Via the Yoneda embedding, we identify $T$ itself as the full subcategory of small $T$-indexed sets within the category of all $T$-indexed sets, such that we may speak, for example, of functions from objects of $T$ to $T$-indexed sets. Note that small sets are closed under finite limits.

When $T$ is a lexcategory, we may also define more generally the concept of a function $f : A \to B$ between $T$-indexed sets having \defined{small fibers}: This is defined as every fiber of $f$ over every object $t$ in $T$ being a representable presheaf over $T/t$.

\begin{TODOblock}
Make sure this is the right definition of small fibers and word it the best way. The definition can equally be given as $f$ being the pullback of the slice of global sections of the self-indexing above the self-indexing (though what we mean by pullback here is a pullback of a discrete fibration along a function, which is technically slightly distinct from a pullback of functions. Whatever.).
\end{TODOblock}

We can talk about any kind of $T$-indexed structure or $T$-indexed maps between such structures, as the appropriate diagram of $T$-indexed sets and functions; e.g., $T$-indexed groups and group homomorphisms between them. When the $T$-indexed sets involved are all small, we say the entire structure is \defined{small}, or equivalently, we say it is \defined{internal} to $T$. By the Yoneda lemma, this amounts to a diagram of objects and morphisms within $T$ itself.

In the same vein as all this, by a \defined{$T$-indexed category}, we mean a category-valued presheaf on $T$; that is, a contravariant functor from $T$ to $\Cat$, and by a \defined{functor} between $T$-indexed categories, we mean a natural transformation between such presheaves.\footnote{The machinery of indexed categories is equivalent to the machinery of fibered categories, a presentation some prefer, but we refrain from that presentation for now.} We say this indexed category is an \defined{indexed lexcategory} (aka, \defined{has finite limits}) if this presheaf factors through the inclusion of $\LexCat$ into $\Cat$; that is, if it takes every object to a lexcategory and every morphism to a lexfunctor. We say a functor between indexed categories \defined{preserves finite limits} if it arises from a natural transformation between the corresponding $\LexCat$-valued presheaves. And in the same way as all this, we can speak of \defined{natural transformations} between functors between indexed categories, or any other familiar categorical structure or property.

Note that, from any lexcategory $T$, we obtain a $T$-indexed lexcategory by considering the functor $T/-$ which assigns to each object $t$ of $T$ the slice category $T/t$, and whose action on morphisms is given by pullback. We refer to this as the \defined{self-indexing} of $T$.

We now might like to speak about a category being small, in the sense that its collection of objects and collection of morphisms are small, but there is one nit to be aware of here. We generally speak about categories in such a way as that they do not have come with a particular notion of their set of objects, as such. That is, two categories may be considered equivalent though presented with different ostensible sets of objects. For example, a category comprised of one terminal object, or a category comprised of two terminal objects, are to be considered equivalent categories. So to speak about categories as having a set of objects, we must imagine the carry as carrying more fine-grained equality structure than we normally do.

Specifically, let us say a \defined{strict category} is a set of objects, a set of morphisms, and a set of 2-cells imposing equalities between morphsims, satisfying \TODO. (This set of 2-cells is often ignored when talking about categories, but we allow the extra freedom of it, as it will be useful when working over categories which are not exact. It amounts to allowing the collection of morphisms for a strict category internal to $T$ to exist not within $T$ itself, but within its ex/lex completion). [We may also speak of a \defined{strict functor}, meaning a homomorphism of such structure that preserves all of it on-the-nose, and so on for every other categorical notion.]

Every strict category [or functor or etc], gives rise to a category [or functor or etc] in whatever ordinary sense one would like to think of these. And conversely, one would ordinarily say every category is equivalent to \emph{some} strict category.\footnote{The situation is more nuanced for turning functors between arbitrary categories equivalent to given strict categories into strict functors between the given strict categories, but that will not concern us for now.} Of course, we can speak of \defined{indexed strict categories} now, as the appropriate diagram of indexed sets and functions between them, and can speak of such indexed strict categories as being small, just in case their indexed sets of objects, of morphisms, and of 2-cells are all small.

We also say an indexed strict category is \defined{locally small} if both the map from its set of morphisms to the pair of their domain and codomain, and the map from its set of 2-cells to the pair of their domain and codomain, have small fibers (in other words, though its set of objects may not be small, everything that exists between any two particular objects is small). Note that a small strict category is a fortiori locally small, as expected, as the collection of morphisms or 2-cells between any particular pair of objects are given by an equalizer between sets already presumed small in a small strict category.

We will now say an indexed category is \defined{small} or \defined{locally small} if it is equivalent to some indexed strict category which is small or locally small, respectively. Note that we do not demand that, as part of its structure, any particular such strict category is selected; merely, that it is possible to do so.

The self-indexing $T/-$ of a lexcategory $T$ is not in general small, nor even locally small. Given two globally defined objects $A$ and $B$ of the self-indexed category, their corresponding hom-set $\Hom_{T/-}(A, B)$ amounts to the presheaf $\Hom_{T}(A \times -, B)$ on $T$, which is to say, the exponential $B^A$ within the presheaves over $T$. This indexed set is small just in case an exponential object $B^A$ already exists within $T$. This extends in the same way to non-globally-defined objects of the self-indexed category (considered as globally defined over some slice category of $T$ instead), and so the self-indexing of $T$ is locally small just in case $T$ is locally cartesian closed. Even if we do not have local cartesian closure in full, note that when $A = 1$, the exponential $B^A$ always is given by $B$ itself, so that hom-sets whose domain is $1$ are always small within the self-indexed category, with $\Hom_{T/-}(1, B)$ being the same as $B$ itself. In this way, the global sections presheaf upon the self-indexed category yields the canonical equivalence between the self-indexed category and the category of small sets.

As a final bit of terminology, given any kind of indexed data, indexed over a category with a terminal object, we may refer to the data of this presheaf at that terminal object as its \defined{global aspect}. More generally, we may refer to the data of this presheaf at any other object $t$ of the category over which it is indexed as its data \defined{defined over $t$}, or which is \defined{$t$-indexed}. Note that data defined over $t$ is automatically transferred to corresponding data defined over $s$ by any morphism from $s$ to $t$ in $T$, by the action of the presheaf. In contexts where it would cause no confusion to speak in this way, we use the same name of the data over $t$ again for the corresponding data over $s$, especially when $t$ is the terminal object. \TODOinline{Do we actually do this often?}

\subsection{The basics of double indexing}
Suppose $T$ is some category and $C$ is some category indexed over $T$. What does it mean to speak of a $T$-indexed $C$-indexed structure? For example, a $T$-indexed $C$-indexed set. That is, a $T$-indexed $C$-indexed presheaf $P$.

What this means is that, for every object $t$ in $T$ and every $t$-defined object $c$ in $C$, we have some corresponding set of $P$ (the $t$-defined $c$-defined elements of $P$), and we also have a coherent system of pullback maps between these: Along any map $f : s \to t$ in $T$, we can pull back a $t$-defined $c$-defined element of $P$ to an $s$-defined $c$-defined element of $P$ (where the latter $c$ is implicitly the pullback along $f$ of the former $c$). And for any fixed $t$, given a $t$-defined map $g : d \to c$ in $C$, we can pull back a $t$-defined $c$-defined element of $P$ along this to a $t$-defined $d$-defined element of $P$. Both of these systems of pullbacks are functorial, and they also interact with each other \quote{commutatively} in the sense that pulling back along a map $g$ in $C$ and then pulling back along a map $f$ in $T$ is the same as pulling back along the map $f$ in $T$ and then pulling back along the map $g$ in $C$ (where, again, the latter, $g$ is implicitly the pullback along $f$ of the former $g$).

This all amounts to saying that $P$ is in fact indexed over the Grothendieck construction corresponding to $C$.

What about maps between such doubly-indexed sets? Well, this is the same as the notion we get again by thinking of these as in fact singly-indexed over the Grothendieck construction. A natural transformation in that context.

Now that we understand doubly-indexed sets and maps between them, we can also understand doubly-indexed structures in general. Including doubly-indexed strict categories, and everything about doubly-indexed categorical structures works in basically the same fashion.

That all being said, we won't really need any of that just yet. All we will really be using of this is the concept of doubly-indexed sets, and of maps between them.
