There is a 2-category where the 0-cells are lexcategories, the 1-cells are n-internalizing lexfunctors for any n, and the 2-cells are natural transformations of the appropriate sort. Hm.

T contains T' such that for any map from T to J, the corresponding

Suppose K is the initial model of T.

K has an internal initial model of T.

So we have K with K' inside K.

Because K is initial, we have a map from K to Hom(1, K').
Because K' is initial within K, we have a map from K' to Hom(1, K'') within K, where K'' = the image of K' under our first map.
By initiality, the 

K is initial, K' is initial

Suppose M is initial in real life, and N is initial internal to M. Then M maps to Hom(1, N) [because N is a model, and therefore so is Hom(1, N)] 

Suppose theory T has an internal weakly initial T.

Then the theory of a weakly initial T has an internal initial T.

So I map the the internal thing, but also, by initiality, we get a natural transformation.

Say a model is "self-initial" if

T has C internal to it.

We extend T freely to have a natural transformation to its internal C. In so doing, new objects added to T.

Ex/Lex(T) maps by forgetful into
T maps by S into
C maps by P into
---------------------------------

P(S(Y)) is a retract according to its particular Ex/Lex relation?

R(f) is related to S(w)* f pulled back along N_Y(y), which is related to f pulled back along N_P(1)(R(f)).
---

This depends on having P(S(Y)) as the retract of Y. How do we make this happen? Normally we instead have that 1 is a retract of everything with a global point. Well, suppose S(forgetful P(1)) has a global point in C (perhaps by virtue of P(1) having a global point already in T). Then 1 is a retract of S(forgetful P(1)) in C, and so P(1) is a retract of P(S(forgetful P(1))) in Ex/Lex(T). This gets the job done.

1 as a retract of anything in T or C with a global point becomes via S followed by P or just P,
