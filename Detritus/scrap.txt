There is a 2-category where the 0-cells are lexcategories, the 1-cells are n-internalizing lexfunctors for any n, and the 2-cells are natural transformations of the appropriate sort. Hm.

T contains T' such that for any map from T to J, the corresponding

Suppose K is the initial model of T.

K has an internal initial model of T.

So we have K with K' inside K.

Because K is initial, we have a map from K to Hom(1, K').
Because K' is initial within K, we have a map from K' to Hom(1, K'') within K, where K'' = the image of K' under our first map.
By initiality, the 

K is initial, K' is initial

Suppose M is initial in real life, and N is initial internal to M. Then M maps to Hom(1, N) [because N is a model, and therefore so is Hom(1, N)] 

Suppose theory T has an internal weakly initial T.

Then the theory of a weakly initial T has an internal initial T.

So I map the the internal thing, but also, by initiality, we get a natural transformation.

Say a model is "self-initial" if

T has C internal to it.

We extend T freely to have a natural transformation to its internal C. In so doing, new objects added to T.

Ex/Lex(T) maps by forgetful into
T maps by S into
C maps by P into
---------------------------------

P(S(Y)) is a retract according to its particular Ex/Lex relation?

R(f) is related to S(w)* f pulled back along N_Y(y), which is related to f pulled back along N_P(1)(R(f)).
---

This depends on having P(S(Y)) as the retract of Y. How do we make this happen? Normally we instead have that 1 is a retract of everything with a global point. Well, suppose S(forgetful P(1)) has a global point in C (perhaps by virtue of P(1) having a global point already in T). Then 1 is a retract of S(forgetful P(1)) in C, and so P(1) is a retract of P(S(forgetful P(1))) in Ex/Lex(T). This gets the job done.

1 as a retract of anything in T or C with a global point becomes via S followed by P or just P,

Related to \cref{CartesianClosedLocallyIntrosp} is the following construction: Given finite product category $T$, cartesian closed category $D$, a finite product preserving functor $f : T \to D$, a finite product preserving functor $g: D \to T$, we can turn $D$ into a $T$-enriched category $C$ whose set of objects is $\Ob(D)$ and such that $\Hom_C(c, d) = g(c \Rightarrow d)$. As a $T$-enriched category, it can also be thought of as a $T$-indexed category with a constant set of objects. If we furthermore have a natural transformation $\introN$ from $t$ in $T$ to $g(f(t))$, this gives rise to a locally introspective finite product theory $\langle T, C, \introS, \introN \rangle$ where $\introS$ matches $f$ on objects and takes morphism $m : t \to s$ to $g(f(m))$, where $f(m)$ is treated as a global element of $f(t) \Rightarrow f(s)$ and thus $g(f(m))$ is treated as a global element of $g(f(t) \Rightarrow f(s)) = \Hom_D(f(t), f(s))$. Note that $\introN_t : t \to \Hom_D(1, f(t)) = g(f(t))$.

We can extend this construction further. Suppose we have lex category $T$ and lex category $D$, a lex functor $f: T \to D$, and a lex functor $g: D \to T$

(Some analogue of the above holds as well using lex in place of finite product structure throughout, and allowing for the set of objects to vary. But I don't have this on the tip of my tongue right now. The following example will be illustrative to think about for working it out.)

A particular case of the above arises with presheaf categories and Kan extensions. Let $F : A \to B$ be any functor between \setsmall/ categories. This induces by composition a corresponding functor $f : \Psh{B} \to \Psh{A}$. This $f$ preserves all limits and colimits (because they are computed component-wise in presheaf categories), and also has both left and right adjoints (these are the left and right Kan extension operations). In particular, let its right adjoint be $g$. Then $g$ and $f$ satisfy the conditions from above (note that we get our natural transformation from $t$ to $g(f(t))$ as the unit of this adjunction), and so we get a locally introspective theory.

A particular case of THIS arises when $B$ is a poset, $A$ is its underlying discrete set, and $F$ is the corresponding inclusion functor. The introspective theory we get is something like Kripke semantics for a K4 theory. But, hm...

What we want to note is that this construction can be generalized to where $B$ is not a poset, but just a transitive relation. That is, when $B$ is an arbitrary relation on underlying set $A$, we have both the category $\Psh{B}$ of presheaves on the reflexive transitive closure of $B$, as well as the category $\Set^A$, an obvious forgetful functor from the former to the latter, and also a functor from the latter to the former which takes an $A$-indexed set $S$ to the presheaf whose value at any object $x$ is the product (or limit? Well, if we use trees rather than arbitrary posets, there's nothing to worry about here) of the values of $S$ at all objects accessible from $x$. This is basically Kripke semantics. When $B$ is transitive, this should work to give an introspective theory as above. Something something. I need to think this through a little more. But the main idea is, our category $T$ is presheaves on the reflexive closure of $B$, our category $C$ is presheaves on the discrete set underlying $B$, there's an obvious forgetful functor in one direction and the functor in the other direction is given by defining the box operator analogously to Kripke semantics.

Anyway, when $B$ is also well-founded, we should get a local version of Loeb's theorem, in the usual way that well-founded transitive relations correspond under Kripke semantics to GL modal logic. We can impose a size constraint to get introspective theories rather than locally introspective theories. These will become our Kripke models of introspective theories/geminal categories based on well-founded relations, analogous to Birkedal's model of guarded recursion based on the topos of trees.

No, wait, maybe scratch all that about Kan extensions. I don't think that's the right thing to say here anymore. Anyway, look at my discussion of modal logic at https://nforum.ncatlab.org/discussion/6352/necessity-and-possibility/, comment 51114.

Add in thoughts about precategories. Let $F : A \to B$ be any functor between \setsmall/ precategories. This induces by composition a corresponding functor $f : \Psh{B} \to \Psh{A}$, where $\Psh{A}$ means the obvious thing even for precategories. Furthermore, we also have a "prebox" functor from $\Psh{A}$ to $\Psh{B}$ like so: The presheaf $p$ on $A$ is mapped to the presheaf on $B$ which sends each object $b$ to the set of natural transformations from $\Hom_B(b, F(-))$ to $p$, so to speak. That is, ways to choose, for each morphism $m$ in $B$ such that $\dom(m) = b$, an element of $p$ at (one? all? elements of) $F^{-1}(\cod(m))$, such that these choices are natural in the sense that pushing forward the element of $p$ along a morphism $n$ yields the same value as is associated to $F(n) \circ m$.

If $F$ is an identity functor between actual categories, this prebox functor is also the identity. HOWEVER, for identity functors between precategories, this need not hold. An illustrative example is taking the precategory to be the natural numbers, where the morphisms correspond to strict inequality. This corresponds to the notion of box used for step-indexing in the topos of trees.

[Note to self: Is Psh(C) cartesian closed if C is merely a precategory? Yes, because it's the same as Psh(C') where C' is the free category (with identity morphisms) extending C'.

The other thing is, if you take a category C' and view it as a precategory C, and then look at Psh(C) qua precategory vs Psh(C') qua category, these might not exactly line up, because presheaves on C don't have to send identity morphisms to identity functions. But Psh(C') is at any rate a full subcategory of Psh(C), and probably a full subcategory closed under finite limits and perhaps even under exponentials? Anyway, this isn't important for us, we only care about Psh here in the qua precategory sense.]

It is also illustrative, though, to consider the case where $A$ is discrete (no morphisms) and $B$ is a transitive relation on the same objects. This yields the standard appropriate semantics for box as concerns ordinary Kripke models of K4. When B is furthermore well-founded, we get GL. Actually, it is good to consider $B$ to the relation of interest on the same objects PLUS an added object with a unique map to each normal object. This $B$ yields an introspective theory such that the global sections functor takes its geminal category directly corresponding to $\Set^A$.
