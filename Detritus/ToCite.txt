There has unfortunately been a lot of related work done in the years since I stopped thinking about this. :(

We always knew to cite Maietti's work on arithmetic universes. There is now also "GÃ¶del incompleteness through Arithmetic Universes after A. Joyal" (2020) by Joost van Dijk, Alexander Gietelink Oldenziel.

There's also some stuff on coalgebra/algebra coincidence we might want to cite, from Adamek, Milius, and Moss.

Maybe cite "Godel-Rosser's Incompleteness Theorems for Non-Recursively Enumerable Theories by Salehi" and Saraji? I haven't bothered to read this and don't particularly intend to.

Cite Lawvere and Yanofsky on diagonalization in cartesian closed categories.

There's "Reasoning in Arithmetic Universes" by Alan Morrison, which talks about how arithmetic universes have internal free models of finite sketches.
