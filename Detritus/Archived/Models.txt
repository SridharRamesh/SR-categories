\section{Models}

2.B: Models [general theorems on model constructions (e.g., from theories with internal initial models for themselves), and observing specific traditional instances of Goedel’s incompleteness theorem (PA, ZFC, Joyal style arithmetic universes) as models of these structures]

Four kinds of examples of introspective theory:
Any lex category trivially equipped as an introspective theory with its internal C = the terminal category 1.
Free construction (e.g., the initial introspective theory, the theory of GL-Xes more generally)
Sigma-1 theories (sigma-1 PA, sigma-1 ZFC, etc; really Primitive Recursive Arithmetic suffices, this is what arithmetic universes are about, but whatever)
Theories of the initial model of some theory that has internal initial models of itself (theory of the initial topos with NNO, theory of the initial arithmetic universe; these are both examples of the fact that any arithmetic universe contains an internal initial model of any finitely specified lex theory)

There are models of the initial introspective theory (GL-categories) of note as well:
The full PA category, full ZFC category, etc.
Any introspective theory itself [with suitable care about chosen limits and so on]
The actual initial model of any theory with internal initial models of itself [this is just an instance of the last bullet point above]

Even though many of these models make use of some kind of initiality, it's worth noting that the free introspective theory doesn't demand any initiality on C (this can be observed from the fact that any particular initiality statement, that C is an initial topos for example or whatever, will fail in one of these more explicit constructions; this can also be observed from the fact that we can apply any lexfunctor : C -> D to shift the introspective theory into using D as its internal model, for example with D = 1 trivial and terminal)

Note that although we get Loeb's theorem and G2IT from that, we do not get Rosser's strengthening of G1IT. That is, there are 2-valued GL-categories; most simply, the GL-category whose underlying category is the 2-element Boolean algebra and whose internal GL-category is trivial (i.e., the terminal object 1). This is in the same way that ther

I think there was once some thought about making models based on arbitrary PCAs, PCAs with oracles, etc?
