Just as we can extend a GL category C forward along a lexfunctor from C to D (internal to an introspective theory), we can also sometimes extend it backwards along a lexfunctor from D to C; specifically, when the now D-indexed category C1 is furthermore D-\repsmall/.

In particular, we can take D to be something like the maps m : X -> []X such that []m = J_{[]X} : []X -> [][]X and squares between these in C, and then the resulting GL-category D should be furthermore an introspective theory.

Something like the maximum introspective theory within C, or rather, the right adjoint to the functor taking introspective theories T to their underlying GL-category T. Does this make introspective theories something like a reflective subcategory of the GL-categories? But beware, the same X may have multiple X -> []X maps available. But then, that's to be expected, as non-isomorphic X within an introspective theory T may be sent to isomorphic values in the internal GL-category C.

This last thing is something like a Freyd cover argument.

---

To prove that the initial arithmetic universe is an introspective theory, we can use a Freyd cover argument that fails for the initial topos, because the Freyd cover of an AU's two projections are both AU morphisms, but only one of the two projections and not the other is a (logical) topos morphism. To see that both projections are AU morphisms, follow through the details that the Freyd cover is an AU in the first place; the constructions of finite limits and colimits and list objects.

We are not particularly concerned about the details of arithmetic universes, so for us, a definition might as well be: A category with finite limits and finite colimits, in which every internal sketch induces an internal free lex theory, all pullback-stably (although the pullback stability does not even really matter for us; also, things like disjointness of coproducts and every equivalence relation being the kernel pair of its coequalizer and so on do not really matter for us. Note that the poset 0 -> 1 is a perfectly fine GL-category, for example!). From this, every finite sketch has an internal model, and also, this is a finite sketch theory, the two properties of note. Put another way, we need four operations: The free internal lex category at all (but this is trivial, this is the 1-object category), augmenting a lex category freely with an object, freely with a morphism, and freely with an equation between morphisms. We also need to be able to prove internally that the free Set-valued model is the one which arises from the lex theory's global elements, hm. All this freeness is really with respect to Set-valued models.

Perhaps all it takes to have free models of arbitrary finitely presented lex theories is having a free locally cartesian closed category on 1 object. Because a free locally cartesian closed category on N objects is easily augmented to freely introduce morphisms or equations, in both cases by passing to an appropriate slice category. And a free lexcategory should sit within a free LCCC, and we can re-extract its free model as global sections. Finally, the free LCCC on N objects is itself given by a lex theory with only one sort, and thus should be generable from the free LCCC on 1 object.

Does the free theory with free models of arbitrarily finitely presented lex theories have the property of being an introspective theory and not just a geminal category, like the initial AU? Note that, if so, we can then situate every other initiality-flavored geminal category within it as a pushforward of its internal copy of itself.

Always presume X <= Y.

Every (X, Y) introspective theory is also an (X', Y') introspective theory, for X' <= X, Y' <= Y. So in particular, an (X, X)-introspective theory.

Where X is strong enough to define Y, and every Y is an X:

Maybe X being strong enough to define Y isn't necessary for all of these? What happens with (category, pointed category)? What is the role of 1 (X must extend category, Y must extend pointed category?)?

Every (X, Y) introspective theory is itself a GL-X.
Every (X, Y) introspective theory contains an internal GL-Y.

Every GL-Y has an underlying Y, and an internal GL-Y within that, and a homomorphism into that internal thing.

The X-theory of GL-Ys is the underlying X-theory of the initial (X, Y) introspective theory.

For handling enriched uniformly with internal:
Objects form an actual set.
Morphisms live in the self-indexing above the objects.


Set, C^x

Objects live in X, morphisms live in Y

Free such structure which admits a map from the self-indexing of X.

And X, and a map from X to Ys, and a map from the self-indexing of X to C, but also C is suitably \repsmall/.

T is Set, and C is some Set-indexed category whose objects comprise a Set and morphisms above any object comprise a value in the self-indexing T.
The self-indexing assigns to every Set s the category T^s. Hm.

So we get a map from T^s to C^s for each s, in a natural way (thus, T to C).

T-and-C-indexed category

Free A-and-B-indexed category whose objects comprise an A and whose morphisms comprise a B above the objects^2, admitting a morphism from correspondingly indexed version of B. Simple self-indexing on B, raised to the power of A.

(Given a and b in T/a, we get a category T/b)
(Given a, and b in T^a, we get a category (T^a // b))

So Ob(C) is a set, and Mor(C) lives in T^(Ob(C)^2), and for each (a, b), we get a prod-functor from (T^a // b) to the b-defined values of C^a.

The free such thing has what in it? Well, we have (Ob(C) x Ob(C), Mor(C)). So T^(Ob(c) x Ob(c)) // Mor(C) has a functor to the Mor(C)-defined values of C^(Ob(c) x Ob(c)). One object in T^(Ob(C) x Ob(c)) is Mor(C) itself. So Mor(C) maps into C^(Ob(c) x Ob(c)). That is, for every pair of objects, we get map from their hom-object in T into an object in C.

Note that in the well-founded sheaf-theoretic models of GL + X |- []X, a la Birkedal et al, we always get |- ~~[]False. Every node is such that from every node it reaches, there is some terminal node further reachable. Purely axiomatically, ~[]False |- []~[]False |- []False; ergo, |- ~~[]False.

In a topos, we can always define well-founded labelled trees of branching arity blah blah as suitable partial functions from finite lists of branch-indices to labels. We can characterize well-foundedness by an impredicative intersection, and similarly characterize well-formedness of the trees (in terms of labels appropriately corresponding to branch arity). And in general, we can define inductive subsets of an X (and use this for inductive proof or recursive function definition) again by impredicative intersection. [This impredicative intersection is obtaining an initial algebra as the total limit over all algebras]
